Motor-PressureSensor-LCD

Working on a Arduino based project that integrates a Barometer, a L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Controller & a Liquid Crystal Display to
create a automated air pump that pumps are an object loses a certain amount of pressure over time.

Currently working to program pushbuttons and have the pressure sensor control motor start/end & speed.

This is one of my first codes so please excuse any newb issues/faults.
