# Motor-Pressure-LCD

**Work in Progress**

Arduino based project that integrates a Barometer, a L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Controller & a Liquid Crystal Display to
create a automated air pump that pumps air into an object. It continuously monitors air pressure within an object and pumps in more air as the object loses a certain amount of pressure/time.

It measures/displays pressure in units of pascals & millibars.

Currently working to program pushbuttons and have the pressure sensor control motor start/end & speed.

This is one of my first codes so please excuse any newb issues/faults.
